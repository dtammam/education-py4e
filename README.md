Repository for Python for Everyone class and notes

Early adventures on the quest to learn to code!

Welcome to my repo! ðŸ‘‹ This repo was created on 8/15/2021 after a few months of dabbling in the world of code.
I've loved computers since I was a child, and while I dabbled with .bat files, code never really made sense.

This repo represents my early code - learnings from coworkers, friends jmk and ezair, with structure from the honorable Dr. Chuck Severance ðŸ™Œ
